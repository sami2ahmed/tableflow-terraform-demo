# Tableflow Project

This project contains Terraform scripts to provision and configure resources for a data pipeline using AWS and Confluent Cloud. The pipeline integrates Kafka topics, IAM roles, S3 storage, and Confluent Tableflow for managing data streams and schemas. **This project is designed for demonstration purposes and supports integration with Snowflake for downstream data processing.**

## Overview

The Terraform scripts in this project perform the following tasks:
- Create Kafka topics (`stock_trades` and `users`) in Confluent Cloud.
- Configure a Datagen Source Connector to generate sample data for the `stock_trades` and `users` topics.
- Set up an S3 bucket and IAM roles/policies for BYOB (Bring Your Own Bucket) integration with Confluent Tableflow.
- Provision a Confluent Tableflow topic (`stock_trades`) with Iceberg table format.
- Manage API keys for Kafka and Tableflow access.

## Architecture

## Prerequisites

Before using these scripts, ensure you have:
1. **AWS Account**: Required for S3 bucket and IAM role creation.
2. Make sure you configure your aws account locally by running `aws configure`
3. **Confluent Cloud Account**: Required for Kafka, Tableflow, and connector provisioning.

## Required Variables

You need to define the following variables in a `variables.tf` file or provide them via environment variables or a `.tfvars` file. Refer to the sample-tfvars.txt for how to configure them. 
Please note that you can only configure 1 catalog per confluent cluster. 

- **Confluent Variables**:
  - `confluent_cloud_api_key`: Your Confluent Cloud API Key
  - `confluent_cloud_api_secret`: Your Confluent Cloud API Key
  - `environment_display_name`: What you want the name of your environment to be

- **Snowflake Variables**:
Please make a note of the following from your Snowflake open data catalog (Polaris), and configure them in a 
  - `polaris_client_id`: Client ID for Snowflake Open Data Account
  - `polaris_client_secret`: Secret key for Snowflake Open Data Account
  - `snowflake_endpoint`: Endpoint for Tableflow to write to Snowflake Open Data Catalog
  - `snowflake_warehouse`: The name of your open data catalog
  - `snowflake_allowed_scope`: In the format of PRINCIPAL_ROLE:<my-principal-role>, the permission scope when writing to snowflake.

## Deployment Steps

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Define the required variables in a `variables.tf` file or a `.tfvars` file.
3. Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform project.
4. Run `terraform plan` to preview the changes.
5. Run `terraform apply` to provision the resources.

## Outputs

After deployment, the following outputs will be available:
- `kafka_api_key`: The Kafka API key.
- `kafka_api_secret`: The Kafka API secret (sensitive).
- `s3_access_role_arn`: The ARN of the S3 access role.
- `s3_bucket_name`: The name of the S3 bucket.

## Notes

- Ensure that your AWS and Confluent credentials are properly configured before running the scripts.
- The `prevent_destroy` lifecycle rule is set to `false` for API keys to allow re-creation if needed.
- Review the `depends_on` blocks to understand resource dependencies and avoid circular dependencies.
- This project supports integration with AWS Glue or Snowflake for downstream data processing.
